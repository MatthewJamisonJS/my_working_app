# README

=== BEGIN CODE CHALLENGE ===

1. Create a Ruby on Rails app with Tailwind (`rails new --css tailwind`) for showing a catalog of books.

2. Books should have a Title, Author, and ISBN. You should be able to create, edit, and delete books.

3. Add a published date to books and list books sorted by the date they were published; when you update a book's published date or add a new book with a date, it should show up at the correct place in the list. 

NB: Tailwind is primarily there so you don't have to stress about the styling. The app should be user-friendly, but we're not necessarily looking for it to win any design awards. ðŸ˜‰

Point us to your code on GitHub when you're ready. Feel free to take up to a week (the actual exercise shouldn't take that long, but I know people are busy) to complete the challenge.
